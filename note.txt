Every disk has 1 superblock that will contain the information of the blocks free and used.(bitmap)
16 inodes structure 
remaining data blocks
a directory is mapping from name to inode.
Whenever you create a directory the size will be fixed to one block 4KB
File will have size set according to the contents.
So basically a directory is mapping and directory is file too.
